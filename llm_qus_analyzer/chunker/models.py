Based on the Quality User Story (QUS) framework, a user story consists of three parts:
[Role], [Means], and optionally [End]. By definition:
- [Role]: A stakeholder or persona that expresses the need. Typically, [Role] are taken from the softwares application domain.
- [Means]: The phrase or clause that describes the primary capability, action, or system behavior the [Role] wants to perform or see happen. It represents the core functional need of the user story, including any conditions (triggers or preconditions) that are directly tied to that need, indicating by 'when', 'where', etc.
- [Ends]: A direct value of the [Means] for the [Role] or explaining why the [Means] are requested or a dependency on other functionality of the [Means].
Additionally,
the [Role] can be the name of the persona acts as the role: Joe, Alice, and not a subject like I, you, they, etc.
the [Means] should not start with a phrasal modal verb (or semi-modal verb), like "be able to", "want to" etc. Even though if [Role] is not exists, [Means] still can be exists.
the [Ends] should start with a pronoun (if it exist) or verb, not a causal phrase such as "so that", "in order to", "to" etc, and not including any unnecessary text behind it.
Every [Role], [Means] and [Ends] must be **explicitly mentioned** or become a part or substring of the user story.
